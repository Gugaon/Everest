			        Code only under the terms of this License, and You
			        must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource

			   IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, INCLUDING
			   WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF

			   APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE AUTHOR OR THE
			   PUBLISHER BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
			   SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
			   DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK
			   OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE AUTHOR OR THE PUBLISHER HAS BEEN
			   ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
			9. Termination.
			     1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
			        terminate automatically upon any breach by You of any
			        term of this License. Individuals or entities who have
			        received Derivative Works from You under this License,
			        however, will not have their licenses terminated
			        provided such individuals or entities remain in full
			        compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 6, 7,
			        8, 9, 10 and 11 will survive any termination of this
			        License.
			     2. If You bring a copyright, trademark, patent or any
			        other infringement claim against any contributor over
			        infringements You claim are made by the Work, your
			        License from such contributor to the Work ends
			        automatically.
			     3. Subject to the above terms and conditions, this
			        License is perpetual (for the duration of the
			        applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the
			        above, the Author reserves the right to release the
			        Work under different license terms or to stop
			        distributing the Work at any time; provided, however
			        that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
			        License (or any other license that has been, or is
			        required to be, granted under the terms of this
			        License), and this License will continue in full force
			        and effect unless terminated as stated above.

			   shall not, under any circumstances, be responsible for and
			   shall not have any liability in respect of the subject
			   matter of this License. The Publisher makes no warranty
			   whatsoever in connection with the Work and shall not be
			   liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any
			   damages whatsoever, including without limitation any
			   general, special, incidental or consequential damages

			   reserves the right to cease making the Work available to
			   You at any time without notice
			11. Miscellaneous
			     1. This License shall be governed by the laws of the
			        location of the head office of the Author or if the
			        Author is an individual, the laws of location of the
			        principal place of residence of the Author.
			     2. If any provision of this License is invalid or
			        unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not
			        affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder
			        of the terms of this License, and without further
			        action by the parties to this License, such provision
			        shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
			        make such provision valid and enforceable.
			     3. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed
			        waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver
			        or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party

			     4. This License constitutes the entire agreement between
			        the parties with respect to the Work licensed herein.

			   MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS

			   MICROSOFT .NET LIBRARY

			   These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft
			   Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates)
			   and you. Please read them. They apply to the software named
			   above, which includes the media on which you received it, if
			   any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft

			   ·         updates,

			   ·         supplements,

			   ·         Internet-based services, and

			   ·         support services

			   for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If
			   so, those terms apply.

			   BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT
			   ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.

			   IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE PERPETUAL
			   RIGHTS BELOW.

			1.    INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.

			a.    Installation and Use. You may install and use any number of
			copies of the software to design, develop and test your programs.

			b.    Third Party Programs. The software may include third party
			programs that Microsoft, not the third party, licenses to you under
			this agreement. Notices, if any, for the third party program are
			included for your information only.

			2.    ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.

			a.    DISTRIBUTABLE CODE.  The software is comprised of Distributable
			Code. “Distributable Code” is code that you are permitted to
			distribute in programs you develop if you comply with the terms
			below.

			i.      Right to Use and Distribute.

			   ·         You may copy and distribute the object code form of
			   the software.

			   ·         Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors
			   of your programs to copy and distribute the Distributable Code
			   as part of those programs.

			ii.    Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you
			distribute, you must

			   ·         add significant primary functionality to it in your
			   programs;

			   ·         require distributors and external end users to agree
			   to terms that protect it at least as much as this agreement;

			   ·         display your valid copyright notice on your programs;
			   and

			   ·         indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from
			   any claims, including attorneys’ fees, related to the
			   distribution or use of your programs.

			iii.   Distribution Restrictions. You may not

			   ·         alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in
			   the Distributable Code;

			   ·         use Microsoft’s trademarks in your programs’ names or
			   in a way that suggests your programs come from or are endorsed
			   by Microsoft;

			   ·         include Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or
			   unlawful programs; or

			   ·         modify or distribute the source code of any
			   Distributable Code so that any part of it becomes subject to an
			   Excluded License. An Excluded License is one that requires, as
			   a condition of use, modification or distribution, that

			   ·         the code be disclosed or distributed in source code
			   form; or

			   ·         others have the right to modify it.

			3.    SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This
			agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft
			reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more
			rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as
			expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply
			with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to
			use it in certain ways. You may not

			   ·         work around any technical limitations in the
			   software;

			   ·         reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the
			   software, except and only to the extent that applicable law
			   expressly permits, despite this limitation;

			   ·         publish the software for others to copy;

			   ·         rent, lease or lend the software;

			   ·         transfer the software or this agreement to any third
			   party; or

			   ·         use the software for commercial software hosting
			   services.

			4.    BACKUP COPY. You may make one backup copy of the software. You
			may use it only to reinstall the software.

			5.    DOCUMENTATION. Any person that has valid access to your
			computer or internal network may copy and use the documentation for
			your internal, reference purposes.

			6.    EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. The software is subject to United States
			export laws and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and
			international export laws and regulations that apply to the software.
			These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end
			use. For additional information, see www.microsoft.com/exporting.

			7.    SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is “as is,” we may not
			provide support services for it.

			8.    ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for
			supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services
			that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support
			services.

			9.    APPLICABLE LAW.

			a.    United States. If you acquired the software in the United
			States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this
			agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of
			conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live
			govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer
			protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.

			b.    Outside the United States. If you acquired the software in any
			other country, the laws of that country apply.

			10.  LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You
			may have other rights under the laws of your country. You may also
			have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the
			software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws
			of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do
			so.

			11.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU
			BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES,
			GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS OR
			STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT
			CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS,
			MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
			FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

			   FOR AUSTRALIA – YOU HAVE STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER THE
			   AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW AND NOTHING IN THESE TERMS IS INTENDED
			   TO AFFECT THOSE RIGHTS.

			12.  LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN
			RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO
			U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING
			CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

			   This limitation applies to

			   ·         anything related to the software, services, content
			   (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party
			   programs; and

			   ·         claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty,
			   guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other
			   tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

			   It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known
			   about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or
			   exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not
			   allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential
			   or other damages.

			   Please note: As this software is distributed in Quebec, Canada,
			   some of the clauses in this agreement are provided below in
			   French.

			   Remarque : Ce logiciel étant distribué au Québec, Canada,
			   certaines des clauses dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous

			                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
			                     Version 2.1, February 1999

			       Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
			       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

			     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
			       of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
			 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
			 the version number 2.1.]

			                            Preamble

			  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
			freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
			Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
			free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

			  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
			specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
			Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
			can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
			this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
			strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

			  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
			not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
			you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
			for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
			it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
			it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
			these things.

			  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
			distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
			rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
			you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

			  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
			or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
			you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
			code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
			complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
			with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
			it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

			  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
			library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
			permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

			  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
			there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
			modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
			that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
			author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
			introduced by others.

			  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
			any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
			effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
			restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
			any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
			consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

			  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
			ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
			General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
			is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
			this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
			libraries into non-free programs.

			  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
			a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
			combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
			General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
			entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
			Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
			the library.

			  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
			does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
			Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
			of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
			are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
			libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
			special circumstances.

			  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
			encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
			a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
			allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
			library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
			case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
			software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

			  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
			programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
			free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
			non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
			operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
			system.

			  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
			users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
			linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
			that program using a modified version of the Library.

			  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
			modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
			"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
			former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
			be combined with the library in order to run.

			                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
			   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

			  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
			program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
			other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
			this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
			Each licensee is addressed as "you".

			  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
			prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
			(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

			  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
			which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
			Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
			copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
			portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
			straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
			included without limitation in the term "modification".)

			  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
			making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
			all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
			interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
			and installation of the library.

			  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
			covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
			running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
			such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
			on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
			writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
			and what the program that uses the Library does.

			  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
			complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
			you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
			appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
			all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
			warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
			Library.

			  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
			and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
			fee.

			  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
			of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
			distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
			above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

			    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

			    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
			    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

			    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
			    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

			    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
			    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
			    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
			    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
			    in the event an application does not supply such function or
			    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
			    its purpose remains meaningful.

			    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
			    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
			    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
			    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
			    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
			    root function must still compute square roots.)

			These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
			identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
			and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
			themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
			sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
			distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
			on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
			this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
			entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
			it.

			Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
			your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
			exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
			collective works based on the Library.

			In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
			with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
			a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
			the scope of this License.

			  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
			License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
			this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
			that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
			instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
			ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
			that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
			these notices.

			  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
			that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
			subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

			  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
			the Library into a program that is not a library.

			  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
			derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
			under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
			it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
			must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
			medium customarily used for software interchange.

			  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
			from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
			source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
			distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
			compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

			  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
			Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
			linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
			work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
			therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

			  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
			creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
			contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
			library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
			Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

			  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
			that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
			derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
			Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
			linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
			threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

			  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
			structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
			functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
			file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
			work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
			Library will still fall under Section 6.)

			  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
			distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
			Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
			whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

			  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
			link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
			work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
			under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
			modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
			engineering for debugging such modifications.

			  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
			Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
			this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
			during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
			copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
			directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
			of these things:

			    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
			    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
			    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
			    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
			    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
			    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
			    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
			    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
			    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
			    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
			    to use the modified definitions.)

			    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
			    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
			    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
			    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
			    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
			    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
			    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

			    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
			    least three years, to give the same user the materials
			    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
			    than the cost of performing this distribution.

			    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
			    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
			    specified materials from the same place.

			    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
			    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

			  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
			Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
			reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
			the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
			normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
			components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
			which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
			the executable.

			  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
			restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
			accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
			use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
			distribute.

			  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
			Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
			facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
			library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
			the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
			permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

			    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
			    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
			    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
			    Sections above.

			    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
			    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
			    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

			  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
			the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
			attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
			distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
			rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
			or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
			terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

			  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
			signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
			distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
			prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
			modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
			Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
			all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
			the Library or works based on it.

			  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
			Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
			original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
			subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
			restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
			You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
			this License.

			  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
			infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
			conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
			otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
			excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
			distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
			License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
			may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
			license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
			all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
			the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
			refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

			If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
			particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
			and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

			It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
			patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
			such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
			integrity of the free software distribution system which is
			implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
			generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
			through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
			system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
			to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
			impose that choice.

			This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
			be a consequence of the rest of this License.

			  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
			certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
			original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
			an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
			so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
			excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
			written in the body of this License.

			  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
			versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
			Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
			but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

			Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
			specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
			"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
			conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
			the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
			license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
			the Free Software Foundation.

			  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
			programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
			write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
			copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
			Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
			decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
			of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
			and reuse of software generally.

			                            NO WARRANTY

			  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
			WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
			EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
			OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
			KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
			IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
			PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
			LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
			THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

			  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
			WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
			AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
			FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
			CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
			LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
			RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
			FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
			SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
			DAMAGES.

			License

			   THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
			   CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK
			   IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE
			   OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR
			   COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

			   BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT
			   AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE
			   EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE
			   LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION
			   OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

			   1. Definitions
			    a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the
			       Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation,
			       adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other
			       alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or
			       performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any
			       other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or
			       adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the
			       original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection
			       will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
			       this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is
			       a musical work, performance or phonogram, the
			       synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving
			       image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the
			       purpose of this License.
			    b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic
			       works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or
			       performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or
			       subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f)
			       below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of
			       their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which
			       the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form
			       along with one or more other contributions, each
			       constituting separate and independent works in themselves,
			       which together are assembled into a collective whole. A
			       work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered
			       an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of this
			       License.
			    c. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that
			       is listed at https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses
			       that has been approved by Creative Commons as being
			       essentially equivalent to this License, including, at a
			       minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that have
			       the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License
			       Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the
			       relicensing of adaptations of works made available under
			       that license under this License or a Creative Commons
			       jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this
			       License.
			    d. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the
			       original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as
			       appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.
			    e. "License Elements" means the following high-level license
			       attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the
			       title of this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.
			    f. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or
			       entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this
			       License.
			    g. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or
			       artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or
			       entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity
			       can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in
			       the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians,
			       dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,
			       play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or
			       artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case
			       of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal
			       entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other
			       sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the
			       organization that transmits the broadcast.
			    h. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered
			       under the terms of this License including without
			       limitation any production in the literary, scientific and
			       artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its
			       expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet
			       and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work
			       of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a
			       choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
			       composition with or without words; a cinematographic work
			       to which are assimilated works expressed by a process
			       analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting,
			       architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a
			       photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed
			       by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied
			       art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or
			       three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,
			       architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a
			       phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is
			       protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a
			       variety or circus performer to the extent it is not
			       otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
			    i. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under
			       this License who has not previously violated the terms of
			       this License with respect to the Work, or who has received
			       express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights
			       under this License despite a previous violation.
			    j. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of
			       the Work and to communicate to the public those public
			       recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or
			       wireless means or public digital performances; to make
			       available to the public Works in such a way that members of
			       the public may access these Works from a place and at a
			       place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to
			       the public by any means or process and the communication to
			       the public of the performances of the Work, including by
			       public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast
			       the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
			    k. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means
			       including without limitation by sound or visual recordings
			       and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the
			       Work, including storage of a protected performance or
			       phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.

			   2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to
			   reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or
			   rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided
			   for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright
			   law or other applicable laws.

			   3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
			   License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
			   non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
			   copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
			   below:
			    a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or
			       more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated
			       in the Collections;
			    b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
			       Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
			       reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise
			       identify that changes were made to the original Work. For
			       example, a translation could be marked "The original work
			       was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification
			       could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
			    c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
			       incorporated in Collections; and,
			    d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
			    e. For the avoidance of doubt:
			         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
			            jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties
			            through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme
			            cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
			            right to collect such royalties for any exercise by
			            You of the rights granted under this License;
			        ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
			            jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties
			            through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme
			            can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right
			            to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of
			            the rights granted under this License; and,
			        iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the
			            right to collect royalties, whether individually or,
			            in the event that the Licensor is a member of a
			            collecting society that administers voluntary
			            licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise
			            by You of the rights granted under this License.

			   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats
			   whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights
			   include the right to make such modifications as are technically
			   necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
			   Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by
			   Licensor are hereby reserved.

			   4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is
			   expressly made subject to and limited by the following
			   restrictions:
			    a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under
			       the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or
			       the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License
			       with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
			       Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
			       that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of
			       the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to
			       that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not
			       sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that
			       refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties
			       with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
			       Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work,
			       You may not impose any effective technological measures on
			       the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
			       Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
			       recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
			       applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but
			       this does not require the Collection apart from the Work
			       itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If
			       You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
			       must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection
			       any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If
			       You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You
			       must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation
			       any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
			    b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only
			       under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version
			       of this License with the same License Elements as this
			       License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license
			       (either this or a later license version) that contains the
			       same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
			       Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons
			       Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one
			       of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the
			       terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under
			       the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or
			       (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must comply with the
			       terms of the Applicable License generally and the following
			       provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for,
			       the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation
			       You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer
			       or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the
			       terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the
			       recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted
			       to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable
			       License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer
			       to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of
			       warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the
			       Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when
			       You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may
			       not impose any effective technological measures on the
			       Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
			       Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that
			       recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This
			       Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a
			       Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart
			       from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms
			       of the Applicable License.
			    c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any
			       Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has
			       been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all
			       copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to
			       the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the
			       Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
			       and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate
			       another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute,
			       publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
			       Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service
			       or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
			       parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to
			       the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that
			       Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless
			       such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
			       licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent
			       with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
			       identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
			       "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or
			       "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
			       The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented
			       in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the
			       case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such
			       credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
			       authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as
			       part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent
			       as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the
			       avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by
			       this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner
			       set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
			       License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or
			       imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by
			       the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties,
			       as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the
			       separate, express prior written permission of the Original
			       Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
			    d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as
			       may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You
			       Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either
			       by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You
			       must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory
			       action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial
			       to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor
			       agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which
			       any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this
			       License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to
			       be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other
			       derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's
			       honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not
			       assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
			       permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
			       reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this
			       License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

			   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

			   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
			   LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
			   WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
			   STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
			   WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
			   PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
			   DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
			   WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
			   THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT
			   APPLY TO YOU.

			   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
			   APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON
			   ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
			   PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR
			   THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
			   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

			   7. Termination
			    a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
			       terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms
			       of this License. Individuals or entities who have received
			       Adaptations or Collections from You under this License,
			       however, will not have their licenses terminated provided
			       such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with
			       those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive
			       any termination of this License.
			    b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license
			       granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the
			       applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the
			       above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
			       under different license terms or to stop distributing the
			       Work at any time; provided, however that any such election
			       will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
			       license that has been, or is required to be, granted under
			       the terms of this License), and this License will continue
			       in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

			   8. Miscellaneous
			    a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
			       Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license
			       to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
			       granted to You under this License.
			    b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
			       Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original
			       Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
			       granted to You under this License.
			    c. If any provision of this License is invalid or
			       unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the
			       validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of
			       this License, and without further action by the parties to
			       this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the
			       minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
			       enforceable.
			    d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived
			       and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent
			       shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged
			       with such waiver or consent.
			    e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
			       parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are
			       no understandings, agreements or representations with
			       respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not
			       be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in
			       any communication from You. This License may not be
			       modified without the mutual written agreement of the
			       Licensor and You.
			    f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter
			       referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the
			       terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
			       Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
			       1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
			       Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty
			       of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised
			       on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take
			       effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License
			       terms are sought to be enforced according to the
			       corresponding provisions of the implementation of those
			       treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the
			       standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright
			       law includes additional rights not granted under this
			       License, such additional rights are deemed to be included
			       in the License; this License is not intended to restrict
			       the license of any rights under applicable law.
